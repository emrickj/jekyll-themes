# jekyll-themes

These themes were converted from stand-alone themes which are found [here](https://github.com/emrickj/themes).
Use any of these themes as a page layout.  They all use a collection named `webpages`.  The documents in the
collection are displayed as pages.  Set `title` variable in front matter of a document for the page name.  If
you want to display an image with a page, set `image_url` variable in front matter.  Please feel free to
modify any of these themes to suit your own needs.
