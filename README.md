# jekyll-themes

These themes were converted from stand-alone themes which are found [here](https://github.com/emrickj/themes).
Use any of these themes as a page layout.  They all use a collection named `webpages`.  The documents in the
collection are displayed as pages.  Set `title` variable in front matter of a document for the page name.  If
you want to display an image with a page, set `image_url` variable in front matter to the URL of the image.
Please feel free to modify any of these themes to suit your own needs.

If you like to use any of these themes with GitHub Pages, please visit [https://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/) for information on how to set up a collection.  It is also a good idea
to flatten the first page (pull it out of the `webpages` subfolder) when your site builds so that your site can
be accessed without having to specify additional directories or filenames in the URL.  You do this by adding
`permalink: index.html` to the front matter of the first page.
